# chatgptClone
Simple chatGPT clone which uses GPT 3.5 for text completion.

## Environment Variables

You have to replace your `API_KEY` inside the `app.js` file which you can easily generate from https://platform.openai.com . 

## Deployment
This project cannot be deployed anywhere because of the limitations of OpenAI `API_KEY`, but it can be run successfully on the local server.
